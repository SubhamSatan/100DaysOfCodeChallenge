#100daysofcodechallenge

Summary of Today's Learning -

ðŸ“Œ LeetCode Question 1752 - Check if Array is Sorted and Rotated

ðŸ’­ Approach -
âž¡ Iterate through the array(from the second element) and check if the element is lesser compared to the previous element
âž¡Set a count and every time the above condition gets fulfilled increase the counter by one
âž¡If all the elements are equal (edge case) then the array is already sorted and rotated
âž¡If count <=1 return true else return false
