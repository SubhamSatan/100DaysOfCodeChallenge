Hello Connections 



Today is Day 17 of my commitment to 100 Days of Code Challenge #100daysofcodechallenge #100daysofcode 



✒ Summary of Today's Learning - 



📌 CodeStudio - Sum of Two Arrays 



💭 Approach - 



⏩ There will be three types of test cases possible 

First when the first array is greater than the second array

Second when the second array is greater than one array 

Third when the carry comes down 

⏩Iterate through both the arrays keeping in mind the carry and adding it every time to the sum of i and j 

⏩Lastly reverse the array to get the answer as it is easier to store it backwards
